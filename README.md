## Overview
For a final assignment in one of my Javascript classes at Arizona State University, we were to createa Javscript lesson in a blog-like style. This is my submission: the topic on AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript)

## Client
Aesthetic was semi-backseat to the content of the blog article, but the variety of elements needed clear and punctual styling. Outside of creating a diverse, yet harmonious assortment of elements such as the 'pre', the 'code', and tip boxes, the aesthetic just needed a simple, universal appeal. 

## Personal Project Takeaways
The different kinds of elements was inspired by many software usage docs online that typically have concise stylings, especially with notated code. This project definitely contributed to my understandings in Forten, while benefitting me by being able to teach a topic thoroughly.
